<h1>History of Paris</h1>
<p>Paris was founded around the end of the 3rd century BC by the Gauls who were called Parisii. In 52 BC Julius Caesar's legions conquered the territory, founding the Roman city, Lutetia on the earlier settlement.</p>

<h1>Attractions</h1>
<p>1. The tower consists of 18,000 sturdy iron sections (weighing over 10,000 tons) held together by 2.5 million rivets. This innovative structure is now considered a masterful architectural feat and is the most emblematic sight in Paris. Reaching 324 meters in height, the tower was the world's tallest building until the Empire State Building was erected.</p>

<p>2. The most monumental boulevard in Paris used to be a desolate field of marshland until the 17th century, when it was landscaped by André Le Nôtre. A century later, the Parisian city planner Baron Haussman designed the boulevard's elegant buildings. The Champs-Elysées is divided into two parts with the Rond-Point des Champs-Elysées as its intersection.</p>

<p>3. The Musée d'Orsay displays a splendid collection of 19th- and 20th-century art (created from 1848 to 1914) in the converted Gare d'Orsay. This Belle Epoque railway station was built for the Universal Exhibition of 1900.</p>

<p>4. The Arc de Triomphe is dedicated to the soldiers who fought in the French armies of the Revolution and the First Empire (Napoleonic Wars). Napoleon commissioned the building of this mighty structure in 1806 but did not live to see its completion in 1836.</p>

<h1>Interesting Facts About Paris</h1>

<p>1. The Eiffel Tower was supposed to be a temporary installation, intended to stand for 20 years after being built for the 1889 World Fair.</p>
<p>2. There are at least three replicas of the Statue of Liberty in Paris. The most famous of them exists on an island in the middle of the Seine and looks towards her sister statue in New York.</p>

<p>3. Visitors to the Eiffel Tower have to climb 1,665 steps to reach the top – unless they take the elevator! There are a mere 270 steps to reach the Basilica of the Sacré Cœur.</p>
